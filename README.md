# Maze-Solver
Solves Mazes!

Try making your own 50x50 pixel maze for it solve!
#This program fails to work with maze pics that have transparent pixels. If program fails it might be because you...
#...need to convert the image to a jpeg first to get rid of the transparency.
#if the image has color please convert image to black and white, or draw over all color pictures on image that may ruin it. See why below.
#Once done, Add a SINGLE PURE RED (255,0,0) Pixel to act as the starting point.
#Add a SINGLE PURE GREEN (0,255,0) pixel to act as the end point. If there's multiple end points u can give each a pixel
#BORDER OFF THE START OF THE MAZE AND THE END (WITH A COLOR OTHER THAN PURE RED OR GREEN). THIS PREVENTS THE SOLVER FROM
#GOING OUTSIDE OR AROUND THE MAZE!!!
#The reason to draw over color pictures on the maze/convert to black and white is so it doesnt falsley think a picture...
#...is a start point or an end point.

#SOLVE TIMES: (dependent on complication of the maze as well as size)
#for small pics (think 50x50) it is almost instantly solved.
#for medium pics (think 200x200) it is solved in under a minute.
#for larger pics (think 500x500) it is solved in upwards of 20 minutes. to find a directions to ur local Wegmans
#it will take a week or so, although i have not tried.
